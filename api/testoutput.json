Medical News Today Newsletter Can vitamin C prevent or treat COVID-19? Medically reviewed by Cynthia Taylor Chavoustie, MPAS, PA-C \u2014 Written by Zawn Villines on June 8, 2020 Theory Research Alternatives Summary Vitamin C, especially in the form of an intravenous (IV) infusion, is thought to help reverse some of the damage that COVID-19 can cause. There is no proof it can treat or cure coronavirus. Because the novel coronavirus is new, doctors do not fully understand it. All potential treatments remain experimental, and researchers have not yet tested vitamin C or shown that it can treat the virus. There is no evidence to suggest that taking vitamin C is harmful to people with COVID-19 , but there is also no evidence to suggest that it will treat or slow the virus. Researchers are investigating high dose IV injections of vitamin C, not over-the-counter supplements. Learn more in this article.

A 2018 study compared people with severe pneumonia who received a vitamin C, thiamine , and hydrocortisone infusion with those who did not.

In its role as an antioxidant, vitamin C may also help fight inflammation, which can damage the lungs and other organs. Some evidence suggests that people with severe COVID-19 experience dangerous levels of inflammation. However, a 2020 paper cautions that very high doses of vitamin C may change the way immune cells die, increasing the risk of localized inflammation. The authors recommend adding a steroid treatment called a glucocorticoid to reduce this inflammation. Vitamin C levels also tend to decline when a person is unwell, even though the immune system\u2019s need for this vitamin increases. Some doctors believe that taking vitamin C supplements can help prevent this depletion, thereby supporting the immune system. Vitamin C causes few side effects, even at high doses. This means that it may be a safer alternative to riskier treatments.
